# Syntherface: An interface that looks spookily like the Moog Mother-32

This is a react interface that mirrors the Moog Mother-32.

It doesn't make any sound. That's another project.

# What am I? Where Am I going?

Right now, I'm just a couple of knobs of various sizes.

# Knob Stuff:

- Click and drag up and down to change the value of the knob.
- SVG based: works at any scale.
